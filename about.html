<h2>Dear world,</h2>
<p>
I never wanted to be a main character; if left to my own devices, I’m naturally introverted, quiet, and prefer time to myself. I’ve been challenged again and again by merciless circumstances that made me question if the universe was aggressively attempting to show me that all I do will be futile if my starting line was pushed back again and again.
</p>

<p>
However, I was fortunate. I was rudely awakened to the jarring truth that I did not struggle so much in this life only for it to amount to nothing. As corny as it may sound, I am proud of my superpower: no matter what this life or this world has thrown in my way, I chose to keep waking up, keep standing up, and keep living for another day. I never want to let the world win over me — the unpredictability of every 24 hours is the excitement I come back for.
</p>

<p>
I’ve been even more fortunate to find my passions early in life, and then resourceful enough to step up and make my mark in the spaces I want to move. Time is merciless, but time is also motivating — with only so much of it at my hands, I spend my days and energy intentionally, immersing myself deep in my passions (<a href="projects.html" style="text-decoration: underline; color: white;">read more in my projects</a>). I am truly so lucky to feel like there will never be enough time to do all that I want.
</p>

<p>
While I would never wish the first chapters of my life on anyone else, I am also grateful for how they have led me to become who I can be today. It is because I once only knew how to dedicate myself to survival that today, I know what it means to dedicate myself to living.
</p>

<p>
I know a lot and have experienced a lot, but I also know I haven’t experienced too much. I want to always learn but be loosely stubborn to my ideals. As the main character of my story, I commit my life to living unapologetically.
</p>

<p>With love, emu</p>
