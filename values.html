<h3>an unapologetic life:</h3>
<p>
To feel excited by the reality that there is more I want to do than time will allow me; to be overwhelmed by the messes I get myself in on the way to chasing my dreams; to let go of expectations on myself and forget what stress feels like; to make everyday more thrilling than the last; to stay up because I am obsessed with creating and delivering; to crash and fail at first but then to own up and learn, never to burn; to give myself the grace I know I deserve; to bring the right level of energy; to take care of my heart, my body, my mind, and my people; to understand that everything happens for a reason; to be the person the younger version of me would have looked up to; and to live loudly without shame and with the fullest intention.
</p>

<h3>an intentional life:</h3>
<p>
To make space for myself; to dream bigger; to build more; to sweat, cry, and bleed; to invest in myself; to be the black sheep; to disprove my doubts; to stay grounded; to show up to my seat at the table; to open my own doors; to create something bigger than myself; to leave a legacy; to learn endlessly; to accept that an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind, even if the world has tried to blind me countless times; to open my mind; to teach the next generations; to heal my inner child; to chase the wild dreams; to scare myself everyday; to have the guts to be optimistic; to take the leaps of faith; to surprise the world; to wear my heart on my sleeve; and to love.
</p>

<h3>a loving life:</h3>
<p>
Good intentions; unforgettable memories; hustle; independence; ambition; organized calendars; serendipitous coincidences; battle scars; food & beverage hospitality; humans; participation awards; left and right brain; empathy; izakayas; “gifts just because”; gratitude from the heart; vulnerability; new obsessions; mental health conversations; design-thinking product development; watching out for each other; love; paying knowledge forward; reflecting on how far we’ve come; bear hugs; night markets; learning from completely different walks of life; the final 10% that make the first 90% matter; making new friends; proactive communication and active listening; room for second dinner/dessert; and another day to live.
