<h3>my good sides — or, the more interesting works.</h3>
<p>I go by either Emily or Emu, preferably not Emi.</p>

  <p>Previously, I was in the consulting (McKinsey) and finance (Goldman Sachs) industries but learned within 3 years that I was spiraling doing what I thought wouldn’t be a “waste” of my education and talents. Truth be told, I’m an artist at heart...but the “starving artist” mantra I was raised on in the Silicon Valley meant that choosing art would never be as “successful.” I’ve always been most fulfilled when I can show something for this creativity, but it never mattered in the shadows.</p>

  <p><strong>Life is too short to optimize success but never too short to redefine</strong>. Now, I’m blessed to be able to come up with fun + creative new ideas and then motivate teams to bring them to life with me.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Started my own brand <a href="http://karepango.com/" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">karepango.com</a> and poured sweat into pop-up markets. I use apparel as my medium to spread self-expression and the messages I want to spread around my universal dining table: sharing food and meeting new friends from different identities and communities.</li>
    <li>Joined and still actively growing alongside the forefront of how artists <a href="https://www.florafauna.ai/" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">use AI in their workflows</a>. Creating organically.</li>
    <li>Shipped a <a href="https://ramp.com/tools/meeting-cost-calculator" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">Chrome Extension</a> that calculates how much your meeting costs so we can all stop useless meetings. Elon thought it was <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1699655156822864038?s=46&t=08JbjV3zAn9GuyWZ9Klg9Q" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">a great idea</a>.</li>
    <li>Built and opened a new <a href="https://www.residenceofmrmoto.com/" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">restaurant concept</a> (literally from the ground up) in Williamsburg. Managed the very lovely team there, broke records, got some cool press, and decided to leave to protect my health.</li>
    <li>Learned from some really smart people at <a href="https://www.techstars.com/newsroom/introducing-techstars-chicago-2021" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">Techstars ‘21</a> alongside my co-founders to build a consumer tech platform in a space I care about.</li>
    <li>Talked <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6811317140503724032/" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">so much on LinkedIn</a> that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emily-her_mentalhealth-mentalhealthrecovery-mentalhealthatwork-activity-6957746166700617729-FO8c?utm_medium=member_desktop&utm_source=share" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">conferences</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emily-her_anxiety-mentalheathawarenessweek-wellbeingwebinars-activity-7030932028724310016-B5vA?utm_medium=member_desktop&utm_source=share" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">companies</a> actually hired me to talk about mental health in the workplace.</li>
    <li>Also published a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emily-her_mentalhealth-mentalhealthawareness-mentalwellbeing-activity-6938103122582003712-NJ7F?utm_medium=member_desktop&utm_source=share" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">book</a> about my experiences and learnings from mental health challenges. This is the legacy I want to leave behind.</li>
    <li>My <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emily-her_kindnesscontagion-creatives-art-activity-6653362049697091584-kM-q?utm_medium=member_desktop&utm_source=share" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">artwork</a> was recognized by the UN during the COVID-19 pandemic. Had to turn down the offer to work with them because college was in the way, probably shouldn’t have.</li>
    <li>Served in the front-of-house team of ~10 restaurants since I was 16. I don’t intend on ever stopping. I prefer <a href="https://azabu-global.netlify.app/" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">fine-dining Japanese cuisine</a> or <a href="https://www.noda.nyc/" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">Michelin-star restaurants</a> but have done my fair share of hole-in-the-wall hustles.</li>
    <li>Prior to leaving McKinsey, I started the firm’s E-sports/Digital Gaming practice through leading the first proposals, white papers, research artifacts, and conference events.</li>
    <li>Magic happens when you bring together creators from different fields to enjoy good food together. I host dinner parties where invitees come for the meal, but stay for the electrifying brainstorms. A friend lovingly called it a “creative salad” and the name is here to stick.</li>
    <li>My favorite way of staying involved with my AAPI roots is through the creative buzz around them. I help to lead the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/acn_nyc?igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw%3D%3D&utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">NYC Asian Creative Network</a> primarily through organizing events, connecting the community, and elevating our shared identities.</li>
    <li>Performed as a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emily-her_mentalhealth-mentalhealthawareness-mentalhealthintheworkplace-activity-6822937237928456192--L2y?utm_medium=member_desktop&utm_source=share" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">live street artist</a> for the opening art exhibition for Chicago’s 2021 annual “Sundays on State Street” fair. Drew whales in front of the Chicago Theater.</li>
    <li>Paid my way through college by serving at restaurants at the same time + creating my own design agency. Began as 400+ cold emails a day (as a self-taught, scrappy Econ student), finished with 40+ clients. I still accept payment in product.</li>
